# check-stock

## Automatically check the stock status of products

For now this only works for <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/">chapters.indigo.ca</a> because of the HTML of the website.

It will check all the links in the file 'links.txt' contained in this folder. To add/edit/remove a link, simply add/edit/remove the corresponding link in the text file.

### To run on Mac:

1. Open Finder and navigate to the location of this folder (`check-stock`).
2. Double-click the file `check_stock.command`.

If you get a permission error at step 2, then do the following:

1. Open Terminal (<kbd>âŒ˜ Command</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>, type in 'Terminal', press <kbd>Enter</kbd>).
2. Navigate to the `check_stock` folder.
3. Run the following command:
    ```shell
    chmod 111 check-stock.command
    ```
    Double-clicking `check_stock.command` should no longer give the error.
